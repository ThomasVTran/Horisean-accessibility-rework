# Horisean

## This mock webpage serves simultaneously as not only a practice for my HTML and CSS skills, but also as a frame of refrence for whenever I need some sort of small project to remind myself of what HTML or CSS I am missing, if any at all. Upon the assembly, this project flushed out accessiblity issues with CSS consolidation and reorganization. One of the navigation text was not sending users to the paragraph respectively, so I changed it's directive. Added all of my comments to separate sections and point out minor changes I have made to styles.
